Fantastic Power Point

Uses deck.js, compiles sass, convers images to base64 inline in css, concatenates
html files from theme, converts html images to base64 inline and saves the output as
a single file which holds the entire presentation.

```
npm install
PRESENTATION=boilerplate THEME=tkw npm run start
```
